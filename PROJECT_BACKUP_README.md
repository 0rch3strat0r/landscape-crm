## Architecture Details

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Pure HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (no frameworks)
- **Storage**: IndexedDB and localStorage (client-side only)
- **Hosting**: Designed for GitHub Pages (free) or local file system
- **Dependencies**: NONE - completely self-contained

### Key Technical Decisions
1. **Single File Architecture**: Everything in one HTML file for easy distribution
2. **No Backend**: All data stored locally on device
3. **Offline First**: Works without internet after initial load
4. **Mobile First**: Optimized for phone use in the field

## Features Implemented

### Core CRM Features
1. **Dashboard** (Landing Page)
   - Weekly revenue, miles driven, yards serviced metrics
   - Weather alerts for scheduling
   - Business snapshot (hottest service, unpaid invoices, equipment status)
   - Fun facts and quick actions

2. **Today's Schedule**
   - Job cards with status (scheduled/in-progress/completed)
   - Start/complete job buttons
   - Quick invoice generation
   - Expense tracking per job
   - Supplier search integration

3. **Customer Management**
   - Customer list with job history
   - Difficulty ratings (Easy/Normal/Difficult/Nightmare)
   - Search functionality
   - Click-to-call integration
   - Customer details view

4. **Estimate Builder**
   - 6 service categories:
     - Lawn Care
     - Tree & Shrub Care
     - Seasonal Services
     - Landscaping
     - Hardscaping
     - Custom Services
   - Property size-based pricing
   - Manual price overrides on every service
   - Customer difficulty multipliers (up to 2x for nightmare customers)
   - Custom service addition
   - Real-time price calculation

5. **Admin/Settings Section**
   - Base rate configuration
   - Pricing models (square footage, hourly, manual)
   - Difficulty multipliers
   - Service templates
   - All settings persist in localStorage

6. **Invoicing**
   - Quick invoice from jobs
   - Full invoice creation
   - Service selection
   - Payment tracking

7. **Supplier Management**
   - Compare prices across suppliers
   - "Know a guy" manual entry
   - Quick access from job cards

### Spanish/English Toggle
- Button in header switches between languages
- Comprehensive translations for all UI elements
- Saves preference in localStorage
- Company name "Medina Landscaping" stays the same in both languages

## Key Code Sections

### Language Toggle Implementation (line 1535-1872)
```javascript
let currentLang = 'en';
const translations = {
    en: { /* English translations */ },
    es: { /* Spanish translations */ }
};

function toggleLanguage() {
    currentLang = currentLang === 'en' ? 'es' : 'en';
    translatePage();
}
```

### State Management (line 1831-1834)
```javascript
let currentPage = 'today';
let dailyProfit = 485;
let jobsRemaining = 5;
```

### Estimate Pricing Logic (line 2210-2290)
Complex pricing based on:
- Property square footage
- Service type
- Customer difficulty rating
- Manual overrides

### Data Persistence
- Customer data: localStorage key 'customers'
- Jobs data: localStorage key 'jobs'
- Settings: localStorage key 'landscapeSettings'
- Language preference: localStorage key 'preferred-language'

## User Workflow
1. **Phone rings** → Create estimate while on call
2. **Adjust prices** → "Because he knows a guy"
3. **Add custom items** → Japanese Maple trees, etc.
4. **Schedule job** → Pick date/time
5. **Day of service** → Start job, track time
6. **During job** → Discover issues, add expenses
7. **Complete job** → Quick invoice, send to customer
8. **Find supplies** → Compare prices or manual entry

## Recent Changes & Fixes

### Latest Updates
1. Added Spanish/English toggle button in header
2. Comprehensive translations for entire UI
3. Removed "Mike" references (was incorrectly assumed as owner)
4. Changed "Jake" employee reference to generic

## How to Resume Development

### Setup
1. Open this folder: `/mnt/c/Users/carls/OneDrive/Desktop/landscape crm/`
2. Main file to edit: `full-crm-demo.html`
3. Test by opening in browser (no server needed)

### Adding New Features
1. All code is in `full-crm-demo.html`
2. Styles are in the `<style>` section (lines 8-562)
3. HTML structure starts at line 566
4. JavaScript starts at line 1534

### Translation System
To add new text that needs translation:
1. Add `data-translate="key-name"` to HTML element
2. Add translations to both `en` and `es` objects
3. For placeholders use `data-translate-placeholder="key-name"`

### Testing
- Open `full-crm-demo.html` in any browser
- Use Chrome DevTools to inspect localStorage
- Test offline by disconnecting internet
- Test on mobile using responsive mode

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Email Distribution (Current)
- Send `full-crm-demo.html` as attachment
- User saves and opens in browser
- Works immediately, no setup

### Option 2: GitHub Pages (Free hosting)
1. Create GitHub account
2. Create new repository
3. Upload `full-crm-demo.html` as `index.html`
4. Enable GitHub Pages in settings
5. Access at: `https://[username].github.io/[repo-name]`

### Option 3: Local Network
- Put file on shared drive
- Access from any device on network
- No internet required

## Important Notes

### What This IS
- A complete, working CRM system
- 100% private (no data leaves device)
- Free to run (no monthly costs except optional hosting)
- Works offline after first load
- Mobile-first design

### What This IS NOT
- Not cloud-based (no sync between devices)
- Not multi-user (each device has own data)
- Not backed up automatically (user must export)

### Future Enhancement Ideas
- Data export/import functionality
- Print-friendly invoice templates  
- Route optimization
- SMS integration (would require backend)
- Multi-device sync (would require backend)
- Automated backups

## Contact & Support
This system was built as a standalone solution. For modifications:
1. All code is in the single HTML file
2. Use browser DevTools for debugging
3. localStorage.clear() resets all data
4. Check browser console for errors

## Session Summary
Built a complete landscaping CRM from scratch following natural workflow of a landscaper. Implemented comprehensive features including estimates, scheduling, invoicing, customer management, and supplier comparisons. Added Spanish/English toggle as final feature. Ready for testing and deployment.
